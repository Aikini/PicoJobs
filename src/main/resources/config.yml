# Some configurations have the ** PREMIUM ONLY ** tag, this means that the configurations are only for the premium version.
# Our plugin uses PlaceholderAPI to make placeholders, it's not required but if you want to use it you need to add it
# A detailed wiki of our plugin can be found here: https://github.com/Picono435/wiki
# All the configurations are commented, but if you still need help check the wiki or send a message in our discord
